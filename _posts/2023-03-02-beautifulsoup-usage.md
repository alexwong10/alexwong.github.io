In web development, "tag soup" is a pejorative for syntactically or structurally incorrect HTML written for a web page. To solve the "tag soup" problem, many HTML parsers have been developed. Among them, BeautifulSoup is
one of the most effective and popular parsers in Python.

Named after a _Lewis Carroll_ poem of the same name in _Alice’s Adventures in the Wonderland_, BeautifulSoup also has a helpful documentation in its official site, with lots of codes use text from _Alice’s Adventures in the Wonderland_ as an example.

In this blog, I would like to introduce the basic usage of BeautifulSoup, along with some problems I met during utilizing it to parse XML file in my experiment.
