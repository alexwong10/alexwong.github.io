### How to write a perfect CV
A CV does not get you a job, what a CV actually gets you is a job interview.

There is absolutely no excuse for a mistake on a CV.

The relevant skills and experience, with the key word here being relevant, need to stand out.

Which type of CV should I write?
- chronological
  - show how well or how quickly you have progressed
  - show off that you had continuous employment with no gaps
- skills-based
  - show off your skills and personal qualities
- hybrid
- technical -> highlight your technical skills such as programming languages, systems and platforms.

Tailor your CV to each job application, showing that you are proactive and motivated.

Minimise gap effect.

Keep it short.

### How to write a perfect cover letter
Include your name, your contact details, the date, and the recruiter's contact details as well.

Use appropriate greetings for your cover letter. 
```
Dear Sir or Madam,
Dear Hiring Manager,
Dear Recruiting Manager,
Dear Human Resources Prfessional
```

A maximum of four paragraphs.
- include why you're writing the letter and the position that you're applying for.
- mention where you found the position and the fact taht your CV is attached.
- add a little extra about yourself, which you couldn't share in your CV.
- disucss your most relevant experience and talk about the specifc qulifications and skills. Sell yourself and avoid repeating CV content.
- thank the employee for their time and consideration.
- Try to promise more information, which should be prepared to fulfill in the interview.
- End with a formal closing.
```
Best regards,
Yours sincerely,
```

Always use full sentences.

Use the passive voice most of the time
```
A promotion to supervisor was awarded to me after only one year. (x)
After only one month, I earned a promotion to manager. (âˆš)
```

Don't use any slang.

Use keys words from the job advert.

Use powerful words and adjectives.
```
get->recive
give->provide
help->assist
answer->reply
choose->select
talk about->discuss
make sure->ensure
tell inform
```

I'm currently a sales intern at The Coffee Bean Co, where I'm being metored by the head of sales. Before that, I was studying for a business degree at the University of Chelsea, and working at a Shoe Shop franchise, where I developed my sales skills.

 I really enjoyed the sales aspects of the retail position, and now I would love to work in a corporated sales position and take on more responsibility, which is why I am so excited about this sales manager position.
