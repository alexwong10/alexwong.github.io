## Welcome to Cheung Wong's Pages

Cheung Wong (pronounced as Xiang HUANG in Mandarian) is studying in Nanjing University. His research interests are natural language processing, software engineering and AI's fairness.

This page is yet not a typical programmer's page. It serves as a record of his normal life. Mainly three topics will be covered.

### Coding

Perhaps most pertinent to his study and work, this blog is about algorithm learning, programming practice and paper reproduction. 

- How to crack tree traversal problem?
- What happened when we say an NLP software is unfair?
- Can we learn C++ in one week?
- ......

### Reading

As a bookworm, he persists in reading various books every week. He will share his opinion in reading and look forward to discussing with you.  
BTW, the page's description 'He felt very young; at the same time unspeakably aged.' is a parody for _Mrs Dalloway_, a famous novel by Virginia Woolf.

### Others

Of course, he is also enthusastic to share fun in football, origami and many other his hobbies. Hope you enjoy it.
