## Yet another blog

Cheung Wong (in Cantonese, pronounced as Xiang HUANG in Mandarian) is studying in Nanjing University. His research interests are natural language processing, software engineering and AI's fairness.

This blog is not a typical programmer's blog. It serves as a record of his normal life. Mainly three topics will be covered.

### Coding

Most pertinent to his study and work, the blog is about computer science knowledge, project practice and paper reproduction. 

- How to crack tree traversal problem?
- What happened when we say an NLP software is unfair?

### Reading

As a bookworm, he would like to share his opinion in reading various books, which is not limited to computer science. To be more specific, he prefers traditional literature. The page's description 'He felt very young; at the same time unspeakably aged.' is a parody for _Mrs Dalloway_, a famous novel by Virginia Woolf.

### Others

He is also ready to introduce different fun facts which he learns in football, origami and many other interesting domains. BTW, his favorite football star is Lionel Messi.
