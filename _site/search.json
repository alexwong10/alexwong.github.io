GitHub Pages embeded in a repository is available for us to create our own website. We can use the Jekyll Theme Chooser to load a pre-made theme and then modify the content and style. The site address will be limited as username.github.io in default.We can configure our website’s information in the file _config.yml.theme: jekyll-theme-minimaltitle: YOUR-WEBSITE-TITLEdescription: YOUR-WEBSITE-DESCRIPTIONBesides, we can rewrite the README.md as we like, which will be the introduction of the website.Adding ContentThe main types of content for Jekyll sites are pages and posts.PagesA page is for standalone content that isn’t associated with a specific date, such as an “About” page. We can add following YAML frontmatter to the top of the file so that it can be published on https://USERNAME.github.io/URL-PATHlayout: pagetitle: \"PAGE TITLE\"permalink: /URL-PATH/PostsA post is a blog post. The default Jekyll site contains a directory named _posts that contains a default post file. Similar to page setting, we can add following YAML frontmatter to the top of the file.layout: posttitle: \"POST TITLE\"date: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss -0000categories: CATEGORY-1 CATEGORY-2We can control the publishing path in _config.yml.Build LocallyIn order to write in a way of What You See Is What You Get, we also want to preview and test changes to our site locally, rather than push it to github and wait for it to be built every time we finish a blog.PrerequisitesFirst, we need to configure local environment. Install Jekyll Create a Jekyll site. The key process is to create a Gemfile and write necessary dependencies. Jekyll is a static site generator with built-in support for GitHub Pages and a simplified build process. Jekyll takes Markdown and HTML files and creates a complete static website based on your choice of layouts.Through command bundle exec jekyll serve, we can build our blog in default on 127.0.0.0:4000. Static pages generated will be stored on local _site directory."
