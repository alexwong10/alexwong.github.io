<p>Hibernate is a high-performance Object/Relational persistence and query service. It is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) solution for JAVA. Hibernate not only takes care of the mapping from Java classes to database tables (and from Java data types to SQL data types), but also provides data query and retrieval facilities.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ORM: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique for converting data between relational databases and object oriented programming languages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hibernate sits between traditional Java objects and database server to handle all the works in persisting those objects based on the appropriate O/R mechanisms and patterns.</p>

<p>Here are some Hibernateâ€™s advantages.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Takes care of mapping Java classes to database tables using XML files and without writing any line of code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provides simple APIs for storing and retrieving Java objects directly to and from the database.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is change in the database or in any table, then you need to change the XML file properties only.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Abstracts away the unfamiliar SQL types and provides a way to work around familiar Java Objects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does not require an application server to operate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Manipulates Complex associations of objects of your database.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minimizes database access with smart fetching strategies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provides simple querying of data.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>

<p>Hibernate has a layered architecture which helps the user to operate without having to know the underlying APIs. Hibernate makes use of the database and configuration data to provide persistence services (and persistent objects) to the application.</p>

<center><img src="./assets/img/posts/20220722/hibernate_architecture.png" /></center>

<p>Hibernate uses various existing Java APIs, like JDBC, Java Transaction API(JTA), and Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI). JDBC provides a rudimentary level of abstraction of functionality common to relational databases, allowing almost any database with a JDBC driver to be supported by Hibernate. JNDI and JTA allow Hibernate to be integrated with J2EE application servers.</p>

<h3 id="configuration-object">Configuration Object</h3>

<p>The Configuration object is the first Hibernate object you create in any Hibernate application. It is usually created only once during application initialization. It represents a configuration or properties file required by the Hibernate.</p>

<p>The Configuration object provides two keys components âˆ’</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Database Connection âˆ’ This is handled through one or more configuration files supported by Hibernate. These files are hibernate.properties and hibernate.cfg.xml.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Class Mapping Setup âˆ’ This component creates the connection between the Java classes and database tables.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sessionfactory-object">SessionFactory Object</h3>

<p>Configuration object is used to create a SessionFactory object which in turn configures Hibernate for the application using the supplied configuration file and allows for a Session object to be instantiated. The SessionFactory is a thread safe object and used by all the threads of an application.</p>

<p>The SessionFactory is a heavyweight object; it is usually created during application start up and kept for later use. You would need one SessionFactory object per database using a separate configuration file. So, if you are using multiple databases, then you would have to create multiple SessionFactory objects.</p>

<h3 id="session-object">Session Object</h3>

<p>A Session is used to get a physical connection with a database. The Session object is lightweight and designed to be instantiated each time an interaction is needed with the database. Persistent objects are saved and retrieved through a Session object.</p>

<p>The session objects should not be kept open for a long time because they are not usually thread safe and they should be created and destroyed them as needed.</p>

<h3 id="transaction-object">Transaction Object</h3>

<p>A Transaction represents a unit of work with the database and most of the RDBMS supports transaction functionality. Transactions in Hibernate are handled by an underlying transaction manager and transaction (from JDBC or JTA).</p>

<p>This is an optional object and Hibernate applications may choose not to use this interface, instead managing transactions in their own application code.</p>

<h3 id="query-object">Query Object</h3>

<p>Query objects use SQL or Hibernate Query Language (HQL) string to retrieve data from the database and create objects. A Query instance is used to bind query parameters, limit the number of results returned by the query, and finally to execute the query.</p>

<h3 id="criteria-object">Criteria Object</h3>
<p>Criteria objects are used to create and execute object oriented criteria queries to retrieve objects.</p>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>Hibernate requires to know in advance â€” where to find the mapping information that defines how your Java classes relate to the database tables. Hibernate also requires a set of configuration settings related to database and other related parameters. All such information is usually supplied as a standard Java properties file called hibernate.properties, or as an XML file named hibernate.cfg.xml.</p>

<p>I will consider XML formatted file hibernate.cfg.xml to specify required Hibernate properties in my examples. Most of the properties take their default values and it is not required to specify them in the property file unless it is really required. This file is kept in the root directory of your applicationâ€™s classpath.</p>

<h2 id="session">Session</h2>
<p>A Session is used to get a physical connection with a database. The Session object is lightweight and designed to be instantiated each time an interaction is needed with the database. Persistent objects are saved and retrieved through a Session object.</p>

<p>The session objects should not be kept open for a long time because they are not usually thread safe and they should be created and destroyed them as needed. The main function of the Session is to offer, create, read, and delete operations for instances of mapped entity classes.</p>

<p>Instances may exist in one of the following three states at a given point in time âˆ’</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>transient âˆ’ A new instance of a persistent class, which is not associated with a Session and has no representation in the database and no identifier value is considered transient by Hibernate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>persistent âˆ’ You can make a transient instance persistent by associating it with a Session. A persistent instance has a representation in the database, an identifier value and is associated with a Session.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>detached âˆ’ Once we close the Hibernate Session, the persistent instance will become a detached instance.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A Session instance is serializable if its persistent classes are serializable. A typical transaction should use the following idiom âˆ’</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Session session = factory.openSession();
Transaction tx = null;

try {
   tx = session.beginTransaction();
   // do some work
   ...
   tx.commit();
}
catch (Exception e) {
   if (tx!=null) tx.rollback();
   e.printStackTrace(); 
} finally {
   session.close();
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If the Session throws an exception, the transaction must be rolled back and the session must be discarded.</p>

<h2 id="persistent-class">Persistent Class</h2>
<p>The entire concept of Hibernate is to take the values from Java class attributes and persist them to a database table. A mapping document helps Hibernate in determining how to pull the values from the classes and map them with table and associated fields.</p>

<p>Java classes whose objects or instances will be stored in database tables are called persistent classes in Hibernate. Hibernate works best if these classes follow some simple rules, also known as the Plain Old Java Object (POJO) programming model.</p>

<p>There are following main rules of persistent classes, however, none of these rules are hard requirements âˆ’</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>All Java classes that will be persisted need a default constructor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All classes should contain an ID in order to allow easy identification of your objects within Hibernate and the database. This property maps to the primary key column of a database table.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All attributes that will be persisted should be declared private and have getXXX and setXXX methods defined in the JavaBean style.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A central feature of Hibernate, proxies, depends upon the persistent class being either non-final, or the implementation of an interface that declares all public methods.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All classes that do not extend or implement some specialized classes and interfaces required by the EJB framework.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The POJO name is used to emphasize that a given object is an ordinary Java Object, not a special object, and in particular not an Enterprise JavaBean.</p>

<h2 id="mapping-files">Mapping Files</h2>
<p>An Object/relational mappings are usually defined in an XML document. This mapping file instructs Hibernate â€” how to map the defined class or classes to the database tables?</p>

<p>Though many Hibernate users choose to write the XML by hand, but a number of tools exist to generate the mapping document. These include XDoclet, Middlegen and AndroMDA for the advanced Hibernate users.</p>

<p>You should save the mapping document in a file with the format <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;classname&gt;.hbm.xml</code>.</p>

<h2 id="mapping-types">Mapping Types</h2>

<p>When you prepare a Hibernate mapping document, you find that you map the Java data types into RDBMS data types. The types declared and used in the mapping files are not Java data types; they are not SQL database types either. These types are called Hibernate mapping types, which can translate from Java to SQL data types and vice versa.</p>

<h2 id="annotations">Annotations</h2>
<p>So far you have seen how Hibernate uses XML mapping file for the transformation of data from POJO to database tables and vice versa. Hibernate annotations are the newest way to define mappings without the use of XML file. You can use annotations in addition to or as a replacement of XML mapping metadata.</p>

<p>Hibernate Annotations is the powerful way to provide the metadata for the Object and Relational Table mapping. All the metadata is clubbed into the POJO java file along with the code, this helps the user to understand the table structure and POJO simultaneously during the development.</p>

<p>If you going to make your application portable to other EJB 3 compliant ORM applications, you must use annotations to represent the mapping information, but still if you want greater flexibility, then you should go with XML-based mappings.</p>

<h3 id="entity-annotation">@Entity Annotation</h3>

<p>The EJB 3 standard annotations are contained in the javax.persistence package, so we import this package as the first step. Second, we used the @Entity annotation to the Employee class, which marks this class as an entity bean, so it must have a no-argument constructor that is visible with at least protected scope.</p>

<h3 id="table-annotation">@Table Annotation</h3>

<p>The @Table annotation allows you to specify the details of the table that will be used to persist the entity in the database.</p>

<p>The @Table annotation provides four attributes, allowing you to override the name of the table, its catalogue, and its schema, and enforce unique constraints on columns in the table. For now, we are using just table name, which is EMPLOYEE.</p>

<h3 id="id-and-generatedvalue-annotations">@Id and @GeneratedValue Annotations</h3>

<p>Each entity bean will have a primary key, which you annotate on the class with the @Id annotation. The primary key can be a single field or a combination of multiple fields depending on your table structure.</p>

<p>By default, the @Id annotation will automatically determine the most appropriate primary key generation strategy to be used but you can override this by applying the @GeneratedValue annotation, which takes two parameters strategy and generator that Iâ€™m not going to discuss here, so let us use only the default key generation strategy. Letting Hibernate determine which generator type to use makes your code portable between different databases.</p>

<h3 id="column-annotation">@Column Annotation</h3>

<p>The @Column annotation is used to specify the details of the column to which a field or property will be mapped. You can use column annotation with the following most commonly used attributes âˆ’</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>name</strong> attribute permits the name of the column to be explicitly specified.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>length</strong> attribute permits the size of the column used to map a value particularly for a String value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>nullable</strong> attribute permits the column to be marked NOT NULL when the schema is generated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>unique</strong> attribute permits the column to be marked as containing only unique values.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
