<p>Why to Learn Spring?</p>

<p>Spring framework is an open source Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing robust Java applications very easily and very rapidly.</p>

<p>It is lightweight when it comes to size and transparency. The basic version of Spring framework is around 2MB.</p>

<p>The core features of the Spring Framework can be used in developing any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE platform. Spring framework targets to make J2EE development easier to use and promotes good programming practices by enabling a POJO-based programming model.
Here is the list of few of the great benefits of using Spring Framework.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>POJO Based - Spring enables developers to develop enterprise-class applications using POJOs. The benefit of using only POJOs is that you do not need an EJB container product such as an application server but you have the option of using only a robust servlet container such as Tomcat or some commercial product.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Modular - Spring is organized in a modular fashion. Even though the number of packages and classes are substantial, you have to worry only about the ones you need and ignore the rest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Integration with existing frameworks - Spring does not reinvent the wheel, instead it truly makes use of some of the existing technologies like several ORM frameworks, logging frameworks, JEE, Quartz and JDK timers, and other view technologies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Testablity - Testing an application written with Spring is simple because environment-dependent code is moved into this framework. Furthermore, by using JavaBeanstyle POJOs, it becomes easier to use dependency injection for injecting test data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Web MVC - Springâ€™s web framework is a well-designed web MVC framework, which provides a great alternative to web frameworks such as Struts or other over-engineered or less popular web frameworks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Central Exception Handling - Spring provides a convenient API to translate technology-specific exceptions (thrown by JDBC, Hibernate, or JDO, for example) into consistent, unchecked exceptions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lightweight - Lightweight IoC containers tend to be lightweight, especially when compared to EJB containers, for example. This is beneficial for developing and deploying applications on computers with limited memory and CPU resources.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transaction management - Spring provides a consistent transaction management interface that can scale down to a local transaction (using a single database, for example) and scale up to global transactions (using JTA, for example).</p>
  </li>
</ul>
