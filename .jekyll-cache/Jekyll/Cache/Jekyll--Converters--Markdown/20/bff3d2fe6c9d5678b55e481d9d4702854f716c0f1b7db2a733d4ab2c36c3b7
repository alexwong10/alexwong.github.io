  <p>TL;DR:</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Maven began as an attempt to simplify the build processes in the Jakarta Turbine project. There were several projects, each with their own <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ant</code> build files, that were all slightly different. JARs were checked into CVS. We wanted a standard way to build the projects, a clear definition of what the project consisted of, an easy way to publish project information, and a way to share JARs across several projects.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ant</code> is a Java library and command-line tool whose mission is to drive processes described in build files as targets and extension points dependent upon each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The result is a tool that can now be used for building and managing any Java-based project. We hope that we have created something that will make the day-to-day work of Java developers easier and generally help with the comprehension of any Java-based project.</p>

<p>Mavenâ€™s primary goal is to allow a developer to comprehend the complete state of a development effort in the shortest period of time. In order to attain this goal, Maven deals with several areas of concern:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Making the build process easy</li>
  <li>Providing a uniform build system</li>
  <li>Providing quality project information</li>
  <li>Encouraging better development practices</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-object-model-pom">Project Object Model (POM)</h2>
<p>POM is fundamental unit of work in Maven. It is an XML file that resides in the base directory of the project as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pom.xml</code>.</p>

<p>The POM contains information about the project and various configuration detail used by Maven to build the project(s).</p>

<p>Configurations that can be specified in the POM include: project dependencies, plugins, goals, build profiles, project version, developers
mailing list.</p>

<p>Before creating a POM, we should first decide the project group (<strong>groupId</strong>), its name (<strong>artifactId</strong>) and its <strong>version</strong> as these attributes help in uniquely identifying the project in repository. As a result, project notation in repository is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">groupId:artifactId:version</code>.</p>
